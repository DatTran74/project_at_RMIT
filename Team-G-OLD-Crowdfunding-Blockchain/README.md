## Initial solution design
### Scope 

- User-friendly design: Design a straightforward and friendly user interface for simple use, smooth and effective interactions.
- User registration and authentication: Users can create accounts and log in with a secure authentication process.
- Campaign creation: Project owners can create new campaigns which include project descriptions, funding goals, deadlines and other requirements.
- Campaign management - Analytics and Reporting: Project owners can modify and update project details, set milestones and monitor all contributions. Stakeholders can trace fund flows, project updates and decision-making.
- Campaign contribution: Users can contribute their funds to other users’ campaigns appearing on the platform using provided payment methods and keep track of their investments.
- Smart contracts: The crowdfunding process is automated, enforces predetermined campaign rules and ensures that the allocation of funds is transparent based on agreed conditions and milestones.
- Decentralized network: Project owners and stakeholders can participate in funding activities from anywhere in the world, which will minimize reliance on centralized intermediaries. 
- Payment processing: Support all transactions using cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, etc.) and banking methods using debit and credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, etc.). Cryptocurrencies follow regulatory compliance, enhance security, and offer global accessibility without the limitations and additional fees associated with cross-border transactions in traditional banking, providing transparency and trustworthiness in funding and payment processes. Traditional banking methods are also available for users without access to a cryptocurrency wallet, but the transaction process may take longer and not guarantee complete transparency.
- Transparency and Auditability enhancement: Leverage blockchain features to ensure tamper-proof transactions and transparency of the platform, especially in project updates and fund flows.
- Security measures: Implement techniques, algorithms, and smart contracts to protect users, sensitive data, and transactions against data fraud and unauthorized access.   

### Technology   
1. Frontend

2. Backend  
   - Node.js: Javascript runtime environment for developing scalable and efficient backend services.
   - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing off-chain data.
   - Bcrypt: A Node.js encryption library for securely hashing passwords and sensitive data.
3. Smart contract
